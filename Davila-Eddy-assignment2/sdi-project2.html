<p>Hello everyone. My theme changed from week one. Now I am a Heavy Metal rockstar who is about to record his new album and has limited time to write songs and limited time to record them.</p>
<p>Following the flow chart can be very difficult at first. I needed to find which code can create the desired results. My variables were easy to complete. However, everything sort of became a blur, which in time became less and less dense. I was able to place my Procedure, my Boolean Function, My String Function and my Array Funtion. Then everything became a blur again. I am working hard to figure it out and hopefully I will soon.</p>
