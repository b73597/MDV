    <h2>Project 1</h2>

<article>
<p>My theme is based on my everyday commute to work. A simple; yet, easy way to code a story with a series of actions that can be linked from start to finish. I chose this theme because I have no experience with JavaScrip or any type of coding, so I rather play it safe by sticking to easy tasks for now.  .</p>
<p> Before this class I never practiced JavaScript or coding at all. This is all new to me, however, I can see how a story can be turned into code. It is a lot of information for a stranger to the subject; but I will try my best to understand this new language. PS: And just to clarify; I do take the faster bus.</p>
